# Outcome Assay

The kernel is past the "does water move through the pipes?" stage. The next
question is whether a run makes cases more fertile for a human.

## Stages

### Discovery

Discovery asks: what did the run notice that was not already obvious?

Good discovery surfaces a new substrate, hidden dependent, disappearing event,
timing shift, latent asset, adoption boundary, or weird but plausible branch. It
does not need to solve the case. It should make the human want to inspect the
case differently.

### Problem Surface

Problem surface asks: what is the actual pressure point?

Good problem surfacing recovers or sharpens the hidden variable. It turns "the
drone is here" into "the footage is the target," or "add guards" into "the
perimeter excludes the waterline." If the problem surface is wrong, clever
solutions should be capped.

### Collaborative Solution

Collaborative solution asks: what should someone do now?

Good solutions are constraint-aware interventions, strategies, warnings,
products, protocols, or falsification tests. They come after discovery and
problem surfacing, not before them.

## Current Assay

`pnpm assay` is discovery-first. The HTML view defaults to six rows:

- one first-row control case for the drone paparazzi scenario
- five kernel case runs

- `jack-drone-privacy`
- `jack-yacht-perimeter-intrusion`
- `fsd-accident-economy`
- `starship-launch-cost-collapse`
- `glp1-snack-demand-destruction`

The control row is not a kernel run. It is the isolated clean-context sub-agent
answer, shown immediately before the paired drone kernel run. Use `--count=<n>`
to run fewer or more kernel cases; counts above five random-fill from the
remaining registry by default. Use `--deterministic` for a sorted fill,
`--seed=<value>` to replay a random selection, `--cases=a,b,c` to choose exact
cases, and `--all` to run the full registry.

Rows in `out/assay/index.html` are collapsed by default. The headline is the
scan surface: row type, kernel conclusion or control framing, convergence, and
generation-2 movement. The top facts distinguish total rows, kernel cases, and
control cases. The shared page nav links Assay, Microscope, and Architecture.
Expand only the rows worth inspecting.

## Control Lane

The clean-agent control is a baseline answer from a single clean-context agent
with no knowledge of the kernel, assay, or surrounding machinery.

Use it to keep the kernel honest:

- Did the kernel surface anything the clean agent missed?
- Did the kernel make the case easier to judge?
- Did generation 2 sharpen anything the clean agent only gestured at?
- Did the clean agent simply beat the machinery?

The first control is shown as its own row before `jack-drone-privacy`.

## Win Condition

The first outcome gate is simple:

After five cases, did the run surface at least three to five entries a human
would mark `interesting`, `investigate`, or `keeper`?

Kernel scores nominate. Human verdicts are bedrock.

## Feedback Scale

- `dead` - not useful, not worth revisiting.
- `obvious` - true or plausible but already in the visible case.
- `interesting` - worth thinking about.
- `investigate` - worth a follow-up search, case split, or falsification test.
  The button marks intent; it does not start investigation work.
- `keeper` - strong enough to preserve as a candidate insight.

Verdict buttons update the feedback JSON locally in the browser. They do not save
to the repo or a server. Copy or download the JSON when a verdict set should be
preserved.
