# Bugs and Mitigations

This is the kernel's immune memory: mistakes we made or are likely to remake,
plus the mitigation that prevents the same failure from hiding twice.

Use this for confirmed or actionable failures. Use
[`OPERATIONAL_WATCHLIST.md`](./OPERATIONAL_WATCHLIST.md) for patterns that are
still only being watched.

## Entry format

### Short name - YYYY-MM-DD

- **Mistake:** what we optimized for or allowed by accident.
- **Symptom:** how it shows up.
- **Mitigation:** what the kernel must do differently.
- **Tripwire:** the cheap way to detect it.
- **Pass condition:** what proves the mitigation held.
- **Carry forward:** one line for the next build.

## Entries

### Report theater - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** treating artifact volume as visibility.
- **Symptom:** the run produces a long report or trace, but the human cannot see
  pass/fail, survivor changes, stable survivors, or failed checks quickly.
- **Mitigation:** proof-board output. `pnpm build` shows the verdict and
  decision-relevant deltas; optional traces under `out/**` are drill-down only.
- **Tripwire:** a build whose first useful output is a file path, a full report,
  or a trace blob.
- **Pass condition:** stdout is enough to know whether the run passed and what
  changed.
- **Carry forward:** visibility is a budget; rich data is fine, mandatory
  reading is not.

### Novelty theater - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** scoring "novel" as whatever sounds unusual to the model.
- **Symptom:** weird phrasing, speculative leaps, or source-free claims outrank
  ideas that are actually absent from the record.
- **Mitigation:** novelty must expose grounded components: source absence,
  substrate distance, hidden dependents, cluster coverage, or an explicit
  nearest-prior comparison.
- **Tripwire:** a high-novelty candidate whose novelty reason cites no sources,
  substrate, prior cluster, or absence-from-record signal.
- **Pass condition:** every selected candidate can explain why it is new without
  relying on "LLM judged it novel."
- **Carry forward:** novelty is a claim about the search space, not a writing
  style.

### Consensus grading - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** treating agreement as correctness.
- **Symptom:** convergent runs score high while unresolved tension is empty, or
  all selected ideas collapse into the same answer without saying what was lost.
- **Mitigation:** preserve dissent and cross-dial regret. A run should expose
  what the other dial would have kept and where selected branches still disagree.
- **Tripwire:** high score plus no unresolved crux, no rejected sibling worth
  inspecting, and no meaningful contrast between dials.
- **Pass condition:** the digest/report shows stable survivors, changed
  survivors, and the reason the alternate dial would choose differently.
- **Carry forward:** convergence must be earned belief movement, not room mood.

### Rehash as evolution - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** counting generation depth while children restate the same thesis.
- **Symptom:** descendants differ in wording but not mechanism, evidence,
  constraint, prediction, or synthesis.
- **Mitigation:** require `claimed_delta` and classify `delta_class` in the
  lineage ledger. Starve `rehash`; synthesize repeated independent attractors.
- **Tripwire:** high nearest-prior similarity plus weak or empty `claimed_delta`.
- **Pass condition:** a child is kept only if it is `enrichment`,
  `convergence_signal`, or `breakout_seed`; otherwise it is visibly culled.
- **Carry forward:** "what changed besides wording?" is a selection gate.

### Flat cascade - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** rewarding long lists of implications as depth.
- **Symptom:** an unlock answer names many industries but does not show
  substrate removed, branch structure, hidden dependents, or convergence.
- **Mitigation:** score breadth, depth, and synthesis separately. Group by
  substrate removed, then take fertile branches deep.
- **Tripwire:** many first-order effects, no because-chain, no branch map, no
  final synthesis.
- **Pass condition:** high-scoring cascade output contains a breadth map, depth
  chains, and a convergence statement.
- **Carry forward:** breadth is not depth; depth is not synthesis.

### Zeitgeist vibe laundering - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** calling a topical answer a timing-bound thesis.
- **Symptom:** "AI changes everything" style answers pass without dated signals,
  why-now, or a falsifiable miss.
- **Mitigation:** run the +/-5-year test. A zeitgeist candidate must name current
  signals, why timing matters now, and what would falsify it by a date.
- **Tripwire:** the answer would read the same five years earlier or later.
- **Pass condition:** missing dated signals or falsifiability caps or re-tags the
  candidate.
- **Carry forward:** zeitgeist is timing-first, not trend-first.

### Signal leakage - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** giving the generator evaluator-only targets.
- **Symptom:** a withheld prompt contains the hidden thesis, branch map,
  required signal, or prediction the evaluator expects.
- **Mitigation:** separate agent-visible context from evaluator-only targets.
  Leakage scans should cover prompt text, success criteria, current signals, and
  source notes.
- **Tripwire:** a generated answer "recovers" a target phrase already present in
  the visible packet.
- **Pass condition:** visible packets contain evidence and constraints, not the
  answer key.
- **Carry forward:** signals can be input; synthesis targets cannot.

### Contract drift - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** letting docs, generated artifacts, and code disagree about what
  exists or how to run the project.
- **Symptom:** docs point to deleted diagrams, stale language choices, missing
  commands, or generated outputs that are treated as durable truth.
- **Mitigation:** keep source contracts and README/run commands aligned. Generated
  output remains disposable unless promoted by decision.
- **Tripwire:** a README path does not resolve, a stated command fails, or a
  generated artifact becomes the only proof of a design claim.
- **Pass condition:** local read order, commands, and boundary contracts resolve
  on disk.
- **Carry forward:** self-contained means the map matches the territory.

### Microscope indistinguishability - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** changing kernel behavior while the default microscope first screen
  still looks like the previous slice.
- **Symptom:** a human opens `out/microscope/index.html` after a major change and
  has to infer whether anything changed from small labels or hidden fields.
- **Mitigation:** the first viewport must expose current RunTrace facts that name
  the active slice: schema version, generation count, computed fitness, bounded
  child expansion, decay, lens, and failed checks. It must also give a reading
  order and define its terms at the point of use; otherwise visible facts still
  require a narrator.
- **Tripwire:** after a major kernel change, the first screen could be mistaken
  for the previous microscope without scrolling, or a reader can see changed
  fields but cannot say what to inspect first.
- **Pass condition:** the first screen makes the changed contract/behavior
  visible and interpretable before the selector lanes.
- **Carry forward:** visibility has to change shape when the kernel changes shape.

### Hidden control edge - 2026-06-21

- **Mistake:** letting a control decision affect downstream generation without
  its own trace event.
- **Symptom:** generation 2 depends on the gen-1 parent selection, but an
  engineer reading `RunTrace.events` sees generate/fitness/final-select/lens and
  has to infer the parent-selection edge from `GenerationSummary`.
- **Mitigation:** architecture views must mark hidden control edges explicitly.
  If recursion becomes more than fixture-bounded proof mode, emit the parent
  selection as a first-class trace event.
- **Tripwire:** a downstream stage filters, expands, or prunes work based on a
  decision that is not present in `TraceEvent[]`.
- **Pass condition:** every decision that changes reachable candidates is either
  a `TraceEvent` or explicitly named as a non-event control edge in the
  engineer view.
- **Carry forward:** if it controls the next generation, it deserves a trace
  surface.
