# Case Study: Superyacht Waterline Intrusion Detection

## Summary

A superyacht had layered security — dock watch, CCTV, and crew on board — and an intruder still defeated all of it: he entered the water, swam out, climbed onto the tender, climbed onto the yacht, and was eventually found wandering the interior corridors of a 140-meter vessel. In this industry, that is a catastrophic failure. The existing security was real but primitive: human watch-standers and conventional CCTV aimed at decks and boarding points, with the water itself effectively unmonitored. The non-obvious move is not "more guards." It is reframing the perimeter to include the water column and automating classification — sensors that can tell a human swimmer from a dolphin, turtle, or floating debris, distinguish an intruder from crew legitimately working on the hull, and trigger a preset lockdown fast enough for the onboard team to intercept before the interior is breached.

This is a strong Doppl case study because the owner had a solution and it still failed, the obvious fixes scale cost without closing the real gap, and there is a known, constraint-aware answer that can be used as a validation target.

## Source

### Type

Transcript and expert recollection.

### Origin

Derived from a conversation with a superyacht-industry domain expert who described a real management-company incident: a person from shore breached multiple security layers and reached the interior of a very large yacht. The expert framed it as a case where the deployed security "didn't work" because it was too primitive for the actual threat vector.

## Visibility

### Level

Internal.

### Anonymized

Yes.

### Public Summary Allowed

Yes, if framed as a hypothetical but realistic superyacht security case and stripped of personally identifying details.

### Sensitive Details

- Names or identifying details of owners, guests, vessels, management companies, or security staff.
- Exact locations, dates, or operating details that could identify a real incident.
- Specific defensive procedures that should not be presented as operational advice for a named vessel.

### Sharing Notes

Use as a capstone evaluation case and demo artifact, not as a claim about a specific person or vessel. Public versions should keep the scenario anonymized and emphasize the reasoning pattern.

## Problem

### Statement

A high-value yacht was protected by human watch-standers and CCTV, yet an individual entered the water from shore, swam to the vessel, used the tender as a step, climbed aboard undetected, and reached the interior. The owner's question to the industry: build a system that detects this kind of incursion before it reaches the yacht.

### Background

Superyachts treat themselves as private, controlled environments, but their real attack surface is a 360-degree volume that includes the water around and beneath the hull. Conventional security focuses on the obvious boarding points and on human attention, which degrades at night. Normally a high, slippery hull is hard to climb — but when the tender is in the water it provides a step up, quietly removing the assumed physical barrier.

### Why It Matters

For ultra-high-net-worth owners, a stranger reaching the interior is both a personal-safety failure and a reputational catastrophe. The incident also reveals the broader pattern: many superyacht problems are not solved by buying the most dramatic technology, but by correctly identifying the unguarded vector and the real job to be done.

### Current State

Operators rely on CCTV trained on decks and boarding points, plus crew on watch and standard access control. These watch the wrong volume (above the waterline, at known entry points) and depend on fallible human attention.

### Impact

If unsolved:

- An intruder can reach the owner, guests, or interior spaces.
- The operator carries severe liability and reputational damage.
- Adding more of the same (guards, deck cameras) raises cost without closing the water-vector gap.

### Scope

This case focuses on detecting an unauthorized person approaching and boarding a yacht from the water. It does not attempt to solve cyber threats, insider threats, piracy at sea, or full military-grade perimeter defense.

## Purpose

### Goal

Use a real intrusion failure to test whether Doppl can identify the unguarded threat vector and a constraint-aware detection-and-response design, rather than recommending "hire more security."

### Questions

- Can a system recognize that the failure was a perimeter-definition problem (the water), not a staffing problem?
- Can it propose detection that distinguishes a human from marine life and from legitimate crew?
- Can it tie detection to a fast, preset human response instead of just raising an alarm?

### Success Criteria

A strong generated answer should:

- Extend the perimeter to include the water surface and water column.
- Automate classification (human vs. dolphin/turtle/debris; intruder vs. crew).
- Account for night and low-visibility conditions.
- Trigger early enough for the onboard team to intercept before boarding or interior breach.
- Avoid simply adding more guards or more of the same cameras.

### Audience

Doppl builders and evaluators who need a realistic, expert-grounded problem/solution pair for testing idea generation.

## User

### Name Or Role

Yacht management company, captain, security lead, or owner responsible for protecting the vessel and the people aboard.

### Goals

- Detect an incursion before the intruder reaches the yacht or its interior.
- Avoid false alarms on crew or marine life.
- Trigger a fast, rehearsed protective response.
- Keep the owner's experience from feeling like an armed camp.

### Needs

- Coverage of the water vector, including underwater.
- Automated classification so humans are alerted only for real threats.
- Reliable detection at night and in poor visibility.
- Integration with an existing alert-and-lockdown protocol.

### Pain Points

- The real attack surface includes water the current system ignores.
- Human attention degrades over long night watches.
- The tender in the water removes the assumed "too high to climb" barrier.
- More guards and more deck cameras add cost without closing the gap.

## Environment

### Setting

A large yacht at anchor or dock near shore, where a person could enter the water from land or another vessel and approach unseen, often at night.

### Tools Or Systems

- In-water sonar and forward-facing 3D radar.
- AI-analytics CCTV.
- Perimeter drones with thermal cameras for night coverage.
- Crew radios and an existing alert/lockdown protocol with a safe room.

### Inputs

- An incident history showing a successful water-vector breach.
- Knowledge that existing CCTV and human watch failed.
- Operating context: near shore, night, tender in the water.

### External Factors

- IMO and maritime regulations, including limits on emissions and active radio/sonar systems in some areas.
- The cost and visible footprint of large sensor hardware (domes, drones).
- Owner expectation of discretion and comfort.

### Assumptions

- The threat can approach from the water, including underwater.
- Sensors can be tuned to distinguish humans from marine life and crew.
- A preset response exists that the crew can execute quickly.

## Constraints

### Must Distinguish Humans From Marine Life And Debris

A detection system that alarms on every dolphin, turtle, or piece of floating rubbish is operationally useless and will be ignored.

**Rationale:** False positives destroy trust in the system and cause crews to disable or ignore alerts, recreating the original failure.

### Must Not Alert On Legitimate Crew

Crew walk the decks and clean the hull, sometimes near the waterline. The system must treat them as legitimate and reserve alerts for genuine intruders.

**Rationale:** The system has to separate "person who belongs here" from "person who does not," or it produces constant noise.

### Must Work At Night And In Low Visibility

The realistic threat arrives at night, exactly when human watch attention is weakest and conventional CCTV is least effective.

**Rationale:** A daytime-only or good-visibility-only solution fails in the conditions the actual incident occurred in.

### Must Detect Early Enough To Act

Detection has to occur far enough out that the onboard security team can intercept before the intruder boards or reaches the interior.

**Rationale:** An alert that fires after boarding has already failed at the real job; timing is the whole point.

### Regulatory And Footprint Limits

Active systems, emissions, and large hardware are constrained by IMO rules and by the owner's desire not to live behind visible heavy security.

**Rationale:** Some active countermeasures are restricted near port; oversized or conspicuous hardware undermines the discretion owners pay for.

## Failed Attempts

### Human Watch Plus Deck CCTV

**Approach:** Rely on watch-standers and conventional CCTV trained on decks and boarding points.

**Outcome:** An intruder swam to the yacht and boarded undetected, reaching the interior.

**Why It Failed:** The perimeter was defined too narrowly — above the waterline, at known entry points — and depended on human attention that degrades at night.

**Lesson:** The breach came from the vector nobody was watching: the water.

### More Guards And More Of The Same Cameras

**Approach:** Scale up the existing approach with additional personnel and conventional cameras.

**Outcome:** Higher cost, no new coverage of the water vector.

**Why It Failed:** Adding capacity to the wrong volume does not close the actual gap.

**Lesson:** This is a perimeter-definition problem, not a staffing problem.

### Reliance On The "Too High To Climb" Assumption

**Approach:** Assume a high, slippery hull is effectively unclimbable.

**Outcome:** The tender in the water provided a step up, and the intruder climbed aboard.

**Why It Failed:** The assumed physical barrier disappears under normal operating conditions.

**Lesson:** Do not treat a situational barrier as a permanent one.

## Solution

### Summary

Reframe the perimeter as a 360-degree volume that includes the water surface and the water column, then fuse complementary sensors with automated classification and tie them to a preset response. In-water sonar distinguishes a diver from a dolphin at long range; AI-analytics CCTV flags a person entering the water and swimming toward the yacht; thermal-equipped perimeter drones cover the dark. Any confirmed human-in-water detection fires a single clear alert that drives a rehearsed sequence: owner to the safe room, vessel lockdown, security team intercepts.

### Details

The operational design is:

1. Cover the water vector with in-water sonar and forward-facing 3D radar that can classify objects (human vs. marine life vs. debris) at range.
2. Add AI-analytics CCTV that detects a person entering the water and tracks movement toward the hull.
3. Use thermal-equipped perimeter drones for night and low-visibility coverage.
4. Fuse the feeds and apply classification so alerts fire only for a probable human intruder, not crew or wildlife.
5. On a confirmed detection, broadcast one unambiguous alert ("individual in water") to all crew radios.
6. The alert triggers a preset protocol: owner to safe room, lockdown, security team responds and intercepts.

### Why This Solution

The previous setup treated security as humans watching the boarding points. The breach came from the water — an unwatched volume — at night, when attention is weakest. This solution reframes the perimeter to include the water and shifts the work from fallible human vigilance to automated classification, so the scarce human response is triggered early and only for real threats. It closes the actual gap rather than buying more of what already failed.

### Tradeoffs

- Requires capital investment in sonar, radar, analytics, and drones.
- Sensor fusion and classification must be tuned to keep false alarms low.
- Some active systems are regulated near port and must be configured accordingly.
- Hardware footprint must be balanced against the owner's desire for discretion.

### Expected Outcome

An approach from the water is detected and classified before boarding. A single clear alert drives a rehearsed response. The intruder is intercepted before reaching the yacht's interior, without flooding the crew with false alarms.

### Next Steps

- Define required detection ranges by hull size and anchorage type.
- Set an acceptable false-alarm rate and tune classification to it.
- Integrate detection with the existing alert-and-lockdown protocol.
- Confirm which active systems are permissible in port versus international waters.

## Reproducible

### Is Reproducible

Yes, approximately.

### Reproducibility Level

Approximate.

### Steps

1. Provide the problem: a breach occurred despite CCTV and a human watch; the intruder came from the water and reached the interior.
2. Give the constraints: distinguish humans from marine life and crew, work at night, detect early enough to intercept, respect regulatory and footprint limits.
3. Ask a model or team to propose solutions without the known answer.
4. Score whether the answer identifies the water/underwater vector and automated classification with a preset response.
5. Compare against the known solution: sensor fusion across sonar/radar/AI-CCTV/thermal drones, tied to lockdown.

### Required Inputs

- The intrusion problem statement.
- Yacht operating context (near shore, night, tender in water).
- Constraints around false positives, crew, night, timing, and regulation.
- The known solution for evaluator-only comparison.

### Expected Result

A strong system should converge on extending the perimeter into the water, automating classification, and triggering a fast preset response — rather than recommending more guards or more conventional cameras.

### Known Variability

Generated answers may differ in sensor mix (sonar vs. radar vs. thermal vs. analytics) and in how detection ties to response. These can still be directionally correct if they reframe the perimeter to include the water and automate the human-vs-everything-else decision.

## Validator

### Name Or Role

Superyacht-industry security domain expert.

### Relationship To Case

Supplied the original incident and can judge whether proposed answers are plausible in the yacht operating environment.

### Can Validate

- Domain plausibility.
- Operational fit for yacht crew and owner behavior.
- Whether a proposal closes the actual threat vector.
- Whether the answer is meaningfully better than generic "more security."

### Validation Method

Async feedback or live review.

### Notes

The validator is most useful for judging directionality and realism, not as a legal or regulatory authority.

## Open Questions

- What detection range is required for different hull sizes and anchorages?
- What false-alarm rate is acceptable before crews start ignoring alerts?
- Which active systems (sonar, jammers, drones) are permissible in port versus international waters?
- How should the protocol differ at anchor, at dock, and underway?

## Notes

This case should be handled carefully because the superyacht domain is secretive and NDA-constrained. Frame it as a hypothetical but realistic security scenario inspired by expert conversation. The useful evaluation target is the structure of the solution, not any identifying detail.
